* nextjs supports page based routing
* nextjs supports pre-rendering that is helpful in 
    1) perfomance of the app as the page loads quickly
    2) better SEO because page source has more data
* nextjs has two types of pre-rendering 
    1) static generation
    2) server side rendering

* static generation:
    1) static generation without external data
    2) static generation with external data
   -> html pages are generated at build time
   -> this is the defaiult behavour of nextjs to generate static page at build time

   ->production build: page will be pre-rendered one time when we run the build command 

   -> dev build: page will be pre-rendered on EVERY request

    -> getStaticProps:
        -runs only in server side
        -the function will never run client side
        -the code will not be bundled in js when sent to the browser
        -server side code can be written in getStaticProps
            like using fs module and query DB
        -can only be used in pages not regular components    
        -used for prerendering not client side data fetching
        -return object with props key that is an object
        -runs on build time, during dev mode runs on each req.

    * running static generation build
    <link> pre-fetching 
        html file 
        json file also produced

        on naviagion to the link page nextjs uses this json file to create page component client side


        html files + json + js files are generated

        -navigate directly to the page route -> html file will be served
        -navigate from the link 
            ->client side page is created using the js and json prefetched from the server
